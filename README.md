# Student Marks Histogram
A simple Python project I made as a beginner to collect student marks (0-100) and show their distribution in a histogram using Matplotlib. Users enter marks, type 'done', and get a histogram saved as student_marks_histogram.png.

__Requirements__

1.Python 3.x
2.Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
3.Jupyter IDE (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab)

__Setup__

Install Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
Install Jupyter: pip install jupyter

__How to Run__

Open Jupyter IDE (run jupyter notebook or jupyter lab in your terminal).
Navigate to student_marks_histogram.ipynb in the Jupyter interface.
Run all cells to start the program.
Enter marks (e.g., 78, 95, 62) when prompted, and type 'done' to finish.
The program creates and saves a histogram as student_marks_histogram.png and displays it.

__Files__

student_marks_histogram.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Python code.
student_marks_histogram.png: Sample histogram output.


__Ensure Matplotlib and Jupyter are installed to avoid errors.
The code includes comments and error handling for non-numeric or out-of-range inputs.__
