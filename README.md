# Student Marks Histogram

This is a Python project I built to collect student marks (0-100) and show their distribution in a histogram using Matplotlib. Users enter marks, type 'done', and get a histogram saved as student_marks_histogram.png.

__Requirements__
1. Python 3.x
2. Matplotlib (install with: pip install matplotlib)
3. Jupyter IDE (Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab)

__Setup__
1. Install Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
2. Install Jupyter: pip install jupyter

__How to Run__
1. Open Jupyter IDE by running 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' in your terminal
2. Navigate to student_marks_histogram.ipynb in the Jupyter interface
3. Run all cells to start the program
4. Enter marks (e.g., 78, 95, 62) and type 'done' to finish
5. The program saves a histogram as student_marks_histogram.png and displays it

__Files__
1. student_marks_histogram.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Python code
2. student_marks_histogram.png: Sample histogram output

__Notes__
1. Make sure Matplotlib and Jupyter are installed to avoid errors
2. The code has comments and handles errors for non-numeric or out-of-range inputs
